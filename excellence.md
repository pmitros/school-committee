Culture of excellence
==========

I believe every student and teacher in the district should not just
succeed, but excel. We have the resources to do that. We just don't
have the culture. When I mentioned this to a school committee member,
the response was that, by definition, not all students can excel
(which was backed by a statement about some students needing to be in
low percentiles on achievement scores, by definition).

That's not what excellence is about.

Excellence comes from focus, passion, and interest in specific topics,
of which there's an infinite variety. Almost all students at MIT
excel, whether that's by competing in [solar car design
competitions](http://solar-cars.scripts.mit.edu/main/), [teaching in
China](https://ceti.mit.edu/), or organizing [nerdy cultural
experiences for
freshman](http://web.mit.edu/random-hall/www/rush.shtml).

You don't need to be MIT for that to happen; I've seen the same
culture at many schools. My high school had that culture in its
journalism program. Students pursued whatever they were doing -- be it
editorial writing, news reporting, graphic design, advertising,
business development, photography, IT, or otherwise -- with passion
and excellence.

Students who excel at their academic interests -- almost no matter
what they are -- will pass basic math and writing exams as a side
effect. Whether students learn to write on a school newspaper,
crafting a business model, or writing a grant proposal, they'll learn
to write *well*, to target an audience, to be clear, and to
communicate, much better than through synthetic exercise in a
traditional English course.

We have a proof of how programs focused on excellence work in CPSD
already. The language immersion programs, once criticized for piling
too much on students, have proven that students excellening with
dramatically outperform. Amigos is the top-performing school in the
district. Chinese Immersion bumped MLK up several tiers. The Ola
program is small enough that it's hard to have hard numbers, but from
what I've seen (I spent a day visiting a classroom), it is a
district-leading program as well.

We just need to spread and expand such models.

A footnote on diversity
----------

Learning to support all the different ways students may want to excel
is at the core of resolving many of the diversity issues in the
district and supporting all learners, regardless of background or
level.

One school committee member described Cambridge as a town divided
between town and gown, and further divided on racial lines, further
among levels of students, and so on. It seemed accurate, but I'm not
sure [labeling](https://simplypsychology.org/robbers-cave.html)
students is helpful to resolving the problem. It leads to stereotype
threat.  [Multiplication is for White
People](https://www.amazon.com/Multiplication-White-People-Expectations-People%C2%92s/dp/1595588981)
is an excellent book about how this plays out, and the effects it
has.

A model which defines diversity in terms of race/gender/LGBTQ/income
also doesn't support groups which aren't well-labeled or politically
favorable. Such initiatives miss introverts, closet Republicans,
religious divides, less disadvantaged immigrants (who are still often
lonely and isolated), and just about anyone else who doesn't fit one
of the labeled molds.
