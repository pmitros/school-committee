Hello!
------

I'm Piotr Mitros, and I'm running for your Cambridge School Committee.

Why are you running?
====================

While the Cambridge School District is one of the greatest public
school districts in the nation, it's performing greatly below its
potential. CPSD spends [$27,569 per
student](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/ppx.aspx) -- the
fourth highest in the state, has connections to top education
researchers at schools such as MIT, Harvard, Lesley, and other
schools. We have some of the greatest teachers in
Massachusetts. However, CPSD still has several [several failing
schools](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/accountability/report/school.aspx?linkid=31&orgcode=00490310&orgtypecode=6&). Many
high-SES parents are choosing to leave the district, either for the
suburbs or private schools, while many low-SES children are failing
basic math and literacy exams.

In short, I think we can do better. I have the experience in closing
achievement gaps, in helping students succeed, and in helping
organization perform at a very high level. I've done all of that
across a range of settings.

I'm also the proud father of a child now entering CPSD. Making
positive change happen quickly is an absolute top priority for
me. That's why I'm running.

What's your background?
=======================

* **Chief Scientist of edX**. Now just over a half-decade ago, I
  proposed the concept of MITx to MIT, and designed a platform to
  improve university education worldwide. I've interfaced with most of
  the education research communities, and developed a broad
  understanding of what does and doesn't work in education. Despite
  popular press, edX does tremendous amounts of on-campus work, and
  has been incredibly effective at accelerating learning across very
  diverse settings. For example, we were able to work with MIT to
  quadruple the number of correct answers on final exams in solid
  state chemistry, with SJSU -- a school serving a disadvantage
  population -- to bring course completion rates from 59% to 91%, with
  schools around the world, and with having students at community
  colleges master materials from MIT courses.

* **Teaching experience across diverse cultures**. I have taught
    computer science at DLUT and Zhejiang University in China, worked
    with universities in Africa, and have been invovled in projects in
    Monglia, with refugees in Jordan, and in many other
    settings. There are many best practices in serving culturally
    diverse populations which aren't being applied in CPSD.

* **Constructivist and connectivist experience**

* **Policy experience**

* **Organizational experience** 

* Experience in education across a diverse range of cultures,
  including in teachinging in China, educational research projects in
  Nigeria, experimental education projects at MIT, and some experience
  with education in Mongolia, India, and refugee education in Jordan
* Co-founder or key early employee at three new organizations, all of
  which crossed the $100 million mark
* Ph.D from MIT, student of famous computer science educator Jerry
  Sussman, in the intellectual lineage of Seymour Papert
* CPSD parent

The pedagogy I developed in the creation of edX
has successfully closed achievement gaps throughout the developing
world, in community colleges, and at state schools. In that role, I've
served as an interface to many education research communities --
psychometricians, constructivists, connectivists, educational policy
researchers, educational dataminers, and many others. 

In my time, I've seen good ideas and bad ideas in educational systems
all around the world, and in working with educational research
communities, I've seen many incredibly diverse approaches to making
school systems work better. I would like to find a way to integrate
these to make our school system better.

What's your plan?


Well, I believe innovation ought to come from students, parents, and
teachers. The role of the School Committee should mostly be to
facilitate, encourage, support, and streamline. As I've been touring
the Cambridge schools, I've been impressed with the quality of
teachers here. However, there seemed significant issues with how the
school is administered centrally.

If elected, I will focus on a few areas:

* Streamlining processes.
* Reducing central regulations.
* Increasing transparency and improving communications.
* Cheerleading successes.
* Encourage student/teacher/parent initiatives.
* Focus on evidence-based practice.
* Focus on detais and specifics.
* Building a culture of excellence.
* Parent, teacher, and community engagement

### Streamlining Processes ###

The process the school operates under, whether school tours, school
lottery, afterschool registration, or otherwise, are often complex and
burdensome.

This is both an efficiency issue and an equity issue. Children whose
parents are not savvy enough to game the lottery algorithms (or who
don't participate in the lottery) are at a significant
disadvantage. Small changes to the lottery can lead to better outcomes
for all involed.

### Encourage student/teacher/parent initiatives ###

I've heard from many people that CPSD has seen too many changes and
initiatives. I respectfully disagree. CPSD has seen too many
*top-down* changes and initiatives. Organizations can change,
innovate, and improve almost arbitrarily quickly when that change
comes from below. A school committee member told me you can't stop
such innovation. I agree, but there is much we can do to encourage it.

### Reducing Regulations ###

Between the federal, state, and school district regulations, teachers
have surprisingly little room to move. Most of the policies are very
reasonable, but they interact in complex ways. For example, a set

In addition, kids are required to follow a __ page handbook. That's
not really reasonable for either children or parents to understand.

My plan is to work to convert as many rules to guidelines. Guidelines
are helpful -- teachers and schools shouldn't have to reinvent the
wheel. But they should be free to deviate when there is a good
reason. Allowing people to do things differently is the first step to
encouraging bottom-up innovation.

### Increasing transparency ###

Between the [Harvard Graduate School of
Education](http://www.gse.harvard.edu/), [The Lesley Graduate School
of
Innovation](http://www.lesley.edu/graduate-school-of-education/home/),
[Tufts Department of Education](http://ase.tufts.edu/education/), and
others, we have a lot of resources for understanding out school and
school system. 

### Improving communications ###

Right now, the Cambridge School District acts largely as 

### Cheerleading successes ###



### Focus on evidence-based practice ###



### Focus on detais and specifics ###

As a broad brush, the Innovation Agenda had all of the right
buzzwords. However, it did very little good. Broadly speaking, in
organizations, *what* gets done is less important than *how* it gets
done.

### Building a culture of excellence ###



### Parent, teacher and community engagement ###



## What would a dream school look like? ##
