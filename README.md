Hello!
======

I'm Piotr Mitros, and I'm running for your Cambridge School Committee.

Why are you running?
--------------------

The Cambridge School District is performing greatly below its
potential. CPSD spends [$27,569 per
student](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/ppx.aspx) -- more
than [double](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66) the
national average and the fourth highest in the state, has connections
to top education researchers at schools such as MIT, Harvard, Lesley,
and other schools. We have some of the greatest teachers in
Massachusetts. However, CPSD still has several several failing
schools. Many high-SES parents are choosing to leave the district,
either for the suburbs or private schools, while many low-SES children
are failing basic math and literacy exams. We know how to solve these
problems. We've solved these problems in [many
places](https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202260264-Is-Khan-Academy-effective-How-is-it-different-than-other-resources-available-),
and in [many different
ways](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/opinion/sunday/schools-that-work.html). I've
personally lead many projects which have lead to tremendous learning
gains, both for disadvantaged and advantaged students worldwide.

In short, I think we can do better. I have the experience closing
achievement gaps, in helping students succeed, and in helping
organization perform at a very high level across a range of
settings. I'd like to bring that experience to improve your schools.

I'm also the proud father of a child entering CPSD, and I've already
seen several things which have concerned me. Making positive change
happen quickly is an absolute top priority for me. That's why I'm
running.

How can I help?

You can donate to my campaign, help spread the word, and remember to
vote in November.

What's your background?
-----------------------

* **Chief Scientist of edX**. A bit over a half-decade ago, I proposed
    the concept of MITx to MIT, and designed a platform to improve
    university education worldwide. Despite popular press, edX does
    tremendous amounts of on-campus work, and has been incredibly
    effective at accelerating learning across very diverse
    settings. For example, we were able to work with MIT to [quadruple
    the number of correct
    answers](http://web.mit.edu/3.091x/www/3091r%20Final%20report.pdf)
    on final exams in solid state chemistry, with SJSU -- a school
    serving a diverse and disadvantaged population -- to bring course completion
    rates [from 59% to
    91%](https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/upload/ed-tech-paper.pdf)
    (almost entirely closing the achievement gap between SJSU and
    MIT), with schools around the world,
    [online](https://science.mit.edu/news/study-online-classes-really-do-work),
    and with having students at community colleges master materials
    from MIT courses. In this role, I've also interfaced with most of
    the education research communities, including psychometricians,
    constructivists, connectivists, educational policy researchers,
    educational dataminers, and many others, and developed a broad
    understanding of what does and doesn't work in education, as well
    as relationships with top researchers in the field.
* **Teaching experience across diverse cultures**. I have experience
    in education across a diverse range of cultures, including
    teaching in
    [China](http://web.mit.edu/mit-ceti/www/reports/past.htm),
    educational research projects in
    [Nigeria](http://mitros.org/p/carnegie_reporter.pdf), experimental
    education projects at MIT, and in many other nations. I have mixed
    [business experience](http://mitros.org/p/#cultures) in even more
    nations. There are effective practices for serving culturally
    diverse populations worldwide which aren't being applied in
    CPSD. I believe this is partially responsible for some of the
    achievement gaps we are seeing.
* **Experience with constructivist learning**. I have been involved in
    a range of experiments around project-based and group learning,
    both
    [in-person](http://tll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/library/files/EvalRept6002ex-Spring03.pdf)
    and
    [on-line](http://davecormier.com/edblog/2014/02/17/building-an-introductory-physics-course-cmooc-meets-xmooc/).
* **Policy experience**. I have served on policy-guiding bodies
    through the [National Science
    Foundation](http://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CRAEducationReport2015.pdf),
    the [National Academy of
    Education](https://naeducation.org/workshop-on-big-data-in-education-balancing-research-needs-and-student-privacy/),
    and for the [European
    Commission](https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/94cb5fc8-473e-11e7-aea8-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-31396079). I
    served as an expert on issues concerning privacy, assessment, as
    well as use of big data in education.
* **Business experience**. I was a co-founder or key early employee at
    three new organizations, all of which crossed the $100 million
    mark. High-performing organizations require a high degree of
    empowerment for individuals. While CPSD is ahead of most school
    districts in this regard, it is well behind where it ought to
    be. We need to do a better job supporting teachers, students, and
    parents who want to improve our school system.
* **Academic experience**. I hold BS, MS, and Ph.D degrees, all from
    MIT. My [academic lineage](http://mitros.org/p/#geneaology)
    includes educators such as [Jerry
    Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) and
    [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert).
* I am a CPSD parent, and have been a resident of Cambridge for most
    of my life.

I've seen good ideas and bad ideas in educational systems all around
the world, and in diverse educational research communities. I would
like to work to integrate these to make our school system better.

What's your platform?
-----------------

* **Bottom-up innovation.** Progress ought to come from students,
    parents, researchers, and teachers. If you've ever tried to
    improve things in CPSD, you know it's like repeatedly running into
    a brick wall. The role of the School Committee and the
    administration should mostly be to facilitate, encourage, support,
    and streamline rather than to dictate. Organizations can improve
    very quickly when the role of management moves from power and
    control to removing obstacles and empowerment, and when there
    mechanisms to spread best practices. See [my plan for empowering
    students, teachers, and parents](empowerment.md).
* **Effective, transparent management.** The school district has
    several organizational disfunctions, and the school committee, as
    a body, is ineffective. While I'm impressed with most individuals
    in the system, the overall organizational dynamics connecting
    those individuals are broken. Decisions are being made in all the
    wrong places. We have many programs with no real idea whether they
    work. Organizational processes are defunct. Have you tried going
    through the school lottery?  Registering for afterschool? Simply
    moving to modern management techniques, improving transparency and
    communications, and moving towards digital processes can lower
    costs, save both parents and school employees time (giving more
    time to interact with students), and make everything work
    better. See [my plan for streamlining processes](streamline.md).
* **Time in classrooms.** Strategic vision and guidance needs to be
    guided by concrete reality. I've spent time in CPSD classrooms,
    and if elected, I commit to spending at least one full day every
    two weeks in CPSD classrooms, observing what happens.    
* **Evidence-based education.** Over the past few decades, we've
    distilled tremendous numbers of theories about what works in
    education to a rigorous, scientifically-validated understanding of
    what helps students learn. There are no silver bullets; education
    is too complex for that. We need to keep students motivated, give
    them tools to monitor their own learning, and to have feedback and
    remediate when they make a mistake. Those tools can come from
    peers, teachers, parents, technology, or other places. Which works
    best depends on the discipline, age, and economic
    constraints. Applied effectively, these allow underperforming
    students to succeed, and more advanced students to excel.
* **Building a culture of excellence.** I believe every student and
    teacher in the district should not just succeed, but excel. We
    have the resources to do that. We just don't have the
    culture. When I mentioned this to a school committee member, the
    response was that, by definition, not all students can excel (and
    the response was backed by a statement about some students needing
    to be in low percentiles on achievement scores, by definition). That's not what excellence is about. Excellence comes from
    focus, passion, and interest in specific topics, of which there's
    an infinite variety. It doesn't matter what a student wants to do
    -- journalism, community organization, programming, or languages
    -- the school ought to find ways to encourage and support that
    student to excel at it. Students who excel at their academic
    interests -- almost no matter what they are -- will pass basic
    math and writing exams as a side effect. Learning to support all
    the different ways students may want to excel is at the core of
    resolving many of the diversity issues in the district, and to
    supporting all learners, regardless of background or level.

What's not your platform?
-----------------

These are things I believe in, will support, but which may be out of
school committee control:

* **Universal pre-K**. This is something we do need to do, but it
    requires the city council. The school committee doesn't have that
    power alone. We do have the power to have many less expensive
    interventions for engaging pre-K parents before they enter the
    school district. Those can get us part of the way there in the
    interim at minimal cost. I will push for those.
* **Longer elected terms.** The two-year terms mean the school
    committee members are constantly competing and campaigning. We
    ought to at least double the terms.
* **Longer school days.** We need to lengthen the school day. State
    regulations mandate minimum structured learning time, and the
    current school day doesn't leave enough time for things like
    recess. While I'll push for this, it's a complex enough
    reorganization that I'm not sure we'll be able to get this done
    this term.

How else can I help?
-----------------

My hope is that having learned a lesson from the recent kerfuffle in
national politics, we can work together to make sure we avoid similar
ones in local politics. Even if you don't vote for me, please educate
yourself about the candidates, vote, and especially encourage others
to do so as well. Anything you can do -- work mailing lists, social
mailing lists, or otherwise -- to drive people to be knowledgeable and
involved -- will help make Cambridge a better city.
