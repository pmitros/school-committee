Hello!
======

I'm Piotr Mitros, and I'm running for your Cambridge School Committee.

Why are you running?
--------------------

The Cambridge School District is performing greatly below its
potential. CPSD spends [$27,569 per
student](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/state_report/ppx.aspx) -- more
than [double](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66) the
national average and the fourth highest in the state, has connections
to top education researchers at schools such as MIT, Harvard, Lesley,
and other schools. We have some of the greatest teachers in
Massachusetts. However, CPSD still has several [several failing
schools](http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/accountability/report/school.aspx?linkid=31&orgcode=00490310&orgtypecode=6&). Many
high-SES parents are choosing to leave the district, either for the
suburbs or private schools, while many low-SES children are failing
basic math and literacy exams. We know how to solve these
problems. We've solved these problems in many places, and in many
different ways. I've personally lead many projects which have lead to
tremendous learning gains, both for disadvantaged and advantaged
students worldwide.

In short, I think we can do better. I have the experience closing
achievement gaps, in helping students succeed, and in helping
organization perform at a very high level across a range of
settings. I'd like to bring that experience to improve your schools. 

I'm also the proud father of a child entering CPSD, and I've already
seen several things which have concerned me. Making positive change
happen quickly is an absolute top priority for me. That's why I'm
running.

How can I help?
---------------

You can donate to my campaign, help spread the word, and remember to
vote in November.

What's your background?
-----------------------

* **Chief Scientist of edX**. A bit over a half-decade ago, I proposed
  the concept of MITx to MIT, and designed a platform to improve
  university education worldwide. Despite popular press, edX does
  tremendous amounts of on-campus work, and has been incredibly
  effective at accelerating learning across very diverse settings. For
  example, we were able to work with MIT to [quadruple the number of
  correct
  answers](http://web.mit.edu/3.091x/www/3091r%20Final%20report.pdf)
  on final exams in solid state chemistry, with SJSU -- a school
  serving a disadvantage population -- to bring course completion
  rates [from 59% to
  91%](https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/upload/ed-tech-paper.pdf) (almost entirely closing the achievement gap between SJSU and MIT),
  with schools around the world,
  [online](https://science.mit.edu/news/study-online-classes-really-do-work),
  and with having students at community colleges master materials from
  MIT courses. In this role, I've also interfaced with most of the
  education research communities, including psychometricians,
  constructivists, connectivists, educational policy researchers,
  educational dataminers, and many others, and developed a broad
  understanding of what does and doesn't work in education, as well as
  relationships with top researchers in the field.
* **Teaching experience across diverse cultures**. I have experience
  in education across a diverse range of cultures, including
  teaching in [China](http://web.mit.edu/mit-ceti/www/reports/past.htm), educational research projects in
  [Nigeria](http://mitros.org/p/carnegie_reporter.pdf), experimental
  education projects at MIT, and in many other nations. There are
  effective practices serving culturally diverse populations worldwide which
  aren't being applied in CPSD. I believe some of these are
  responsible for some of the achievement gap we are seeing.  
* **Experience with constructivist learning**. I have been involved in
  a range of experiments around project-based and group learning, both
  [in-person](http://tll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/library/files/EvalRept6002ex-Spring03.pdf)
  and
  [on-line](http://davecormier.com/edblog/2014/02/17/building-an-introductory-physics-course-cmooc-meets-xmooc/).
* **Policy experience**. I have served on policy-guiding bodies
    through the [National Science
    Foundation](http://cra.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CRAEducationReport2015.pdf),
    the [National Academy of
    Education](https://naeducation.org/workshop-on-big-data-in-education-balancing-research-needs-and-student-privacy/),
    and for the [European
    Commission](https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/94cb5fc8-473e-11e7-aea8-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-31396079). I
    served as an expert on issues concerning privacy, assessment, as
    well as use of big data in education.
* **Business experience**. I was a co-founder or key early employee at
  three new organizations, all of which crossed the $100 million
  mark. High-performing organizations require a high degree of
  empowerment for individuals. While CPSD is ahead of most school
  districts in this regard, it is well behind where it ought to be. We
  need to do a better job supporting teachers, students, and parents
  who want to improve our school system.
* I hold BS, MS, and Ph.D degrees, all from MIT. My academic lineage
  includes educators such as [Jerry
  Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) and
  [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert).
* I am a CPSD parent, and have been a resident of Cambridge for most
  of my life.

I've seen good ideas and bad ideas in educational systems all around
the world, and in diverse educational research communities. I would
like to work to integrate these to make our school system better.

What's your platform?
-----------------

* **Bottom-up innovation** Progress ought to come from students,
    parents, researchers, and teachers. If you've ever tried to
    improve things in CPSD, you know it's like repeatedly running into
    a brick wall. The role of the School Committee and the
    administration should mostly be to facilitate, encourage, support,
    and streamline rather than to dictate. Organizations can improve
    very quickly when the role of management moves from power and
    control to removing obstacles and empowerment, and when there
    mechanisms to spread best practices. See [my plan for empowering
    students, teachers, and parents](empowerment.md).
* **Effective, transparent management** The school district is badly
    mismanaged. The school committee can barely talk to each
    other. Decisions are being made in all the wrong places. We have
    many programs with no real idea whether they work. Organizational
    processes are defunct. Have you tried going through the school
    lottery? Registering for afterschool? Simply moving to modern
    management techniques, improving transparency and communications,
    and moving towards digital processes can lower costs, save both
    parents and school employees time (giving more time to interact
    with students), and make everything work better. See [my plan for
    streamlining processes](streamline.md).
* **Time in classrooms** Strategic vision and guidance needs to be
    governed in concrete reality. I've spent time in CPSD classrooms,
    and if elected, I commit to spending at least one in fourteen days
    of my time in CPSD classrooms, observing what happens.
* **No silver bullets** 


If elected, I will focus on a few areas:

* **Supporting all learners.** Not all learners needs are the
  same. The school district does a poor job with students outside of
  the mainstream, be they low-SES, advanced learners, kids with
  special needs, non-native speakers, or kids with exceptional
  interests. I want to help the schools support, encourage, and learn
  from the beautiful diversity we have.
* **Building a culture of excellence.** I believe every student and
  teacher in the district should not just succeed, but excel. We have
  the resources to do that. We don't have the culture to do
  that. Excellence comes from focus, passion, and interest. It doesn't
  matter what a student wants to do -- journalism, community
  organization, programming, or sports -- the school ought to find
  ways to encourage and support that student to excel at it.
* **Streamlining processes.** All such processes could be made more
  effective.
* **Increasing transparency, improving communications, and more
  coordination.** This is a quality issue. We have some of the best
  teachers in the world, and we need to find ways to spread best
  practices. This is an equity issue. Parents without strong networks
  have a difficult time figuring out what's going on. This is an
  empowerment issue too. People can't be empowered to act if they don't
  know what's going on.
* **Reducing central regulations.** The school district has a
  tremendous number of very well-thought-out policies. They
  individually make sense, but together, they're disempowering to
  teachers and prevent continued improvement and innovation. I would
  like to convert as many of these as possible from regulations into
  guidelines.
* **Cheerleading successes.** One of the key roles of the school
  committee ought to be identifying what works right -- whether in
  schools, individual classrooms, or even individual students -- and
  promoting it. That both helps build culture of excellence, and helps
  such successes spread.
* **Encouraging student/teacher/parent initiatives.** The most
  effective innovation comes from the people involved in the system.
  The school system moves slowly. I would like to empower everyone
  involved in the process to make the sorts of positive changes we
  need. Did you know that a CPSD teacher has a $500 annual
  discretionary budget? That's $25 per student. We need many times
  that.
* **Focus on evidence-based practice.** We know how to close
  achievement gaps and how to have students learn more
  effectively. We've had countless successes. The core issue is
  they're not being applied. I'd like to fix that.
* **Parent, teacher, and community engagement.** Parents are perhaps
  the most important part of student outcomes. We need for the schools
  to engage all parents early and bring them into working with the
  system.
