        <p> A portion of students in certain demographic groups within the Cambridge School District fail basic math and literacy exams. In addition, students tend to cluster in classes by race and ethnicity. Figuring out why this happens has been difficult because many topics are taboo leading to dialog which hinges on incorrect assumptions and on solutions which fail to address some of the  basicproblem. I am writing this article in the hopes of shifting towards a more open, evidence-based dialog. Let's start with where are. The Cambridge Public School District has a 25-35% gap in performance between low-income and high-income students. Similar gaps exist between white students and people-of-color. Performance in the absolute for low-income demographics has been steadily raising at 1-2% per year. If this continues, we will be at 100% proficiency by around 2040. The gap between low-income and high-income students has been decreasing by a statistically insignificant 0.2% per year:

      <p> The CPSD administration defines diversity in terms of skin color, gender, socioeconomic status, LGBTQ status, and occasionally, nation of origin (indeed, in <a href="http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/Affirmative_Action_Pres_2014.pdf">many CPSD documents</a>, “diversity” is used as short-hand for “percentage people of color”). Virtually all efforts in diversity target those groups based on statistical stereotypes of those groups; a refugee family from Myanmar is in the same demographic group as Harvard graduate students from Beijing University, and a recent immigrant from Kenya is in the same demographic group as someone whose ancestors came into Massachusetts as slaves in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_Massachusetts">1600's</a>. Given the demographics of the district, the groupings are roughly correct, but do misplace many specific individuals (perhaps most commonly, highly-educated graduate students tend to fall into low-income buckets).</p>

      <p> Starting with that set of assumptions, the school district takes a few approaches:</p>

      <ul>
	<li> <b> Integration efforts</b>. All schools are balanced to within a few percent by socioeconomic status. This integration is achieved through a busing system which costs $8.4 million (5% of the school budget), or a lifetime total of around $20,000 per student. Despite high levels of socioeconomic integration between schools, students report feeling that individual classrooms tend to be strongly segregated. </li>
	<li> <b> Social justice</b>. The CPSD byline is “Cambridge Public Schools are built on a foundation of academic excellence and committed to promoting an environment of social justice.” The school has an extensive discussion on issues of social justice integrated into the curriculum </li>
	<li> <b>Reducing perceived effects of disadvantages</b>. For example, there are efforts to combat the effects of early childhood trauma in how discipline is handled in high school </li>
	<li> <b>Recruiting teachers of color</b>. The school district has a goal of 30% </li>
	<li> <b>Differentiated instruction</b>. We have moved away from tracked education to attempting to target all students in common classrooms </li>
      </ul>

    <p> These efforts are slightly scattershot. Almost all come late enough so they do not address some of the key root. Few are grounded in the science of learning; and we have no idea how effective these efforts are. We not only do not understand the effect sizes; for many efforts, we do not even know, in any scientific sense, whether these efforts have a positive or negative net effect. If we wish to have close the gap before 2040, we do want to be a little bit more intentional, rigorous, and methodological in how we do so. In addition, these efforts largely leave behind any kids who do not fit CPSD's rather narrow definition of diversity. I would propose that we should try address these issues systematically and deliberately. Specifically, we we should:
      <ul>
	<li> Understand root causes; </li>
	<li> Evaluate the likely effect sizes of those causes with hard evidence where possible; and </li>
	<li> Do a cost-benefit analysis on particular programs addressing those cose. Some programs are surprisingly cheap, while others are shockingly expensive! </li>
      </ul>

    <p> To get this process going, in the coming weeks, I’ll post a series of strawman hypotheses, proposals for discussion, as well as a few ballpark numbers where available.</p>
