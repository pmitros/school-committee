        <p> A portion of students in the Cambridge School District fail basic math and literacy exams. Students also cluster in classes by race and ethnicity. While I am not an expert here, I am hoping to shift the dialog towards a more evidence-based approach. </p>

	<p> Let's start with where are. The Cambridge Public School District has a 25-35% gap in performance between low-income and high-income students. Similar gaps exist between white students and people of color. Performance for low-income demographics has been steadily raising at 1-2% per year. If this continues at the same rate, we will be at 100% proficiency by around 2040 or 2050. Because performance for high-income students has risen as well at roughly the same pace, the gap between low-income and high-income students has stayed almost constant: </p>

      <p> The CPSD administration defines diversity in terms of race, gender, socioeconomic status, LGBTQ, and occasionally, nation of origin (indeed, in <a href="http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/Affirmative_Action_Pres_2014.pdf">many CPSD documents</a>, “diversity” is used as short-hand for “percentage people of color”). Most efforts target those groups based on statistical aggregate stereotypes of those groups. A refugee family from Myanmar would be in the same low-income Asian demographic as Harvard graduate students from Beijing University, while a recent immigrant from Kenya would be in the same demographic group as someone whose ancestors came into Massachusetts as slaves in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_Massachusetts">1600's</a>. Given the demographics of the district, the groupings fair for a majority of individuals, but still appear to misplace a significant number of individuals.</p>

      <p> Starting with that set of assumptions, the school district takes a few approaches:</p>

      <ul>
	<li> <strong> Integration efforts</strong>. All schools are balanced to within a few percent by socioeconomic status. This integration is achieved through a busing system which costs $8.4 million (5% of the school budget), or a lifetime total of around $20,000 per student. Despite high levels of socioeconomic integration between schools, students report feeling that individual classrooms tend to be strongly segregated. </li>
	<li> <strong> Social justice</strong>. The CPSD byline is “Cambridge Public Schools are built on a foundation of academic excellence and committed to promoting an environment of social justice.” The school has an extensive discussion on issues of social justice integrated into the curriculum </li>
	<li> <strong>Reducing perceived effects of disadvantages</strong>. For example, there are efforts to combat the effects of early childhood trauma in how discipline is handled in high school </li>
	<li> <strong>Recruiting teachers of color</strong>. The school district has a goal of 30% </li>
	<li> <strong>Differentiated instruction</strong>. We have moved away from tracked education to attempting to target all students in common classrooms </li>
      </ul>

	<p> These efforts are slightly scattershot. Many root causes are missed (indeed, until we have universal pre-K, all of these efforts miss the critical 0-4 age range). Few are grounded in the science of learning or psychology. We also have no idea how effective these efforts are; indeed, for many efforts, we do not even know whether, as implemented, the effect is positive or negative. </p>
	<p> If we wish to close the gap before 2040, we want to be very intentional, deliberate, rigorous, and methodological. Specifically, I would propose that we:
	  <ul>
	    <li> Hypothesize root causes of the gap; </li>
	    <li> Evaluate the likely effect sizes of those causes; </li>
	    <li> Come up with multiple proposal to address each one; and </li>
	    <li> Do a cost-benefit analysis on those proposals </li>
	  </ul>

	<p> From there, we could prioritize effectively. Some programs are surprisingly cheap, while others are shockingly expensive.

	<p> To get this process going, in the coming weeks, I’ll post a series of strawman hypotheses, proposals, as well as a few ballpark numbers where available. These won't consitute a platform (the point of hypotheses is that many are incorrect), but rather, the start of a process; I don't have the solutions here, but I expect the community does. What I can do effectively is provide a framework, facilitate the process, and help tie back both to research evidence and to related programs. If you have your own hypotheses, I'm glad to post them as well (please do let me know whether you'd like me to do that anonymously or with credit).</p>
	<!--h2> Hypotheses </h2>
	<ul>
	  <li> Insufficient support for knowledge gaps or misconceptions </li>
	  <li> Lack of access to similar resources (museums, books, developmentally-appropriate toys, etc.) </li>
	  <li> Half the instructional time due to cost of afterschool and summer camp programs </li>
	  <li> Inability of teachers to relate to students' culture/cicumstances </li>
	  <li> Less quality parenting time </li>
	  <li> Drugs/violence/behavioral problems </li>
	  <li> Less developed social/behavior skills </li>
	  <li> Low expectations </li>
	  <li> Racism/microaggressions </li>
	  <li> </li>
	</ul-->
