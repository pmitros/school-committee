CRLS Register Forum News Clippings
================

Student voices are important. The CRLS Register Forum is the oldest
student newspaper in the nation and provides some of those voices.

This is my set of clippings from the Register Forum. I thought I'd
share it in case others found it helpful. Please note the commentary
is not proof-read and likely contains typos and errors.

Data
----

The Register Forum ran a number of surveys providing key data which
may help guide policy decisions:

* Most CRLS students [speak another language
  fluently](news-clippings/2011_Dec_Bilingual.png), and find that it
  helps in their day-to-day lives.
* CRLS is [quite religiously
  diverse](news-clippings/2012_Nov_religious_diversity.png), with
  atheists/agnostics at 46%, Christians at 31%, Jewish at 12%, and
  Muslim at 7%. [More than
  70%](news-clippings/2013_april_religion.png) support seperation of
  church and state in schools.
* However, there is little [political
  diversity](news-clippings/2016_oct_political_diversity.png). 80% of
  the student supported Clinton, followed by Sanders. Under 3% of
  students supported Trump. Likewise, the student body is
  [split](news-clippings/2017_april_conservative.png) between
  'liberal' and 'very liberal,' with a few moderates. The conservative
  minority is often threatened.
* Only about [half](news-clippings/2013_april_homework.png) of
  students find homework useful. Curiously, the article cited research
  literature which showed a correlation between how much homework
  students did and test scores (rather than research literature which
  showed no correlation between how much homework was assigned and
  test scores). A [second survey](news-clippings/2016_homework.png)
  did note the research consensus, and found 70% of CRLS students
  found homework to be a source of stress, and 60% a source of sleep
  deprivation and exhaustion. Qualitatively, students didn't like
  [homework over
  break](news-clippings/2016_jan_homework_over_break.png). Of course,
  reducing or removing homework isn't a question of simply not
  assigning it; homework-free classes need a pretty significant
  restructuring so the same learning happens in class.
* The [vast majority](news-clippings/2013_april_neap.png) -- 82% -- of
  CRLS students find classes to be rigorous enough. Only 7% thought
  they should be more challenging.
* Students overwhelmingly recognize that [suspension doesn't
  work](news-clippings/2013_april_suspension.png). Suspended students
  get a mini-vacation, and fall further behind. What was striking was
  how prevalent suspension was -- 40 out of 88 students surveyed had
  been suspended.
* Students were [split](news-clippings/2013_nov_achievement_gap.png)
  as to who was responsible for solving the achievement gap -- the
  federal government, state government, city government, school
  committee, or the school. Curiously, neither students, parents,
  communities, nor teachers were even listed as an option.
* Most students feel their friends, homeroom, classes, and afterschool
  activities are at least [somewhat
  diverse](news-clippings/2013_nov_diverse_friends.png), or at least felt
  this way in 2013.
* Overall, students thought that [better teachers should be paid
  more](news-clippings/2011_june_good_teachers.png), with a bit of a
  discussion about tests versus student perception as a means of
  evaluating teachers (missing were peer or administor
  evaluations). An article a few years later looked at [what students
  valued in
  teachers](news-clippings/2013_nov_what_students_value_in_classes.png). Top
  was caring about the topic, followed by being available to students.
* There was an [overwhelming
  correlation](news-clippings/2015_may_electronics_academic.png)
  between unplugging digital devices and school performance. 95% of
  kids who had GPAs below 90 used digital devices at least three hours
  per day, while only 14% of those with GPAs above 90 did so. This
  result is strong enough and important enough to be publication-worthy.
* Surprisingly, in a 2014 survey, [56% of students didn't know the
  term
  gender-binary](news-clippings/2014_feb_gender_binary_poll.png). In
  recent years, topics of diversity formed the plurality of articles
  in the Register Forum, so this result might be different today.
* A striking 54% of students feel they have [more stress they can
  manage](news-clippings/2014_april_stress.png), with 62% considering
  school to be the greatest stressor. Students have a number of coping
  strategies, mostly negative ([pg
  1](news-clippings/2014_nov_crls_stress.png) [pg
  2](news-clippings/2014_nov_stress_2.png)).  One of the key questions
  is whether school is fundamentally too stressful, or whether we do
  not do enough to develop resilience and coping strategies.
* Unsurprsingly, most students felt
  [stereotyped](news-clippings/2014_nov_roots_of_prejudice.png) at
  some point in their lives.
* In 2014, [two-thirds of
  students](news-clippings/2014_april_class_size.png) believed classes
  were too large. At the time, 48% of classes had over 20 students,
  while 53% of AP/Honors classes had over 25 students. Absent from the
  discussion were what should be traded off to reduce class size
  (teacher salary, number of teachers per classroom, support/admin
  staff, etc.). Absent from the broader discussion is also the format
  of classes which often have drastically different staffing
  requirements.

Student Government Candidate Profiles
----

Among my favorite articles we saw the reasons many students ran for
student council. As with the school committee, diversity and the
achievement gap were the plurality reason for running, followed by
dress code, but otherwise, choice quotes from the [2015 candidate
profiles](news-clippings/2015_may_candidate_profiles.png) and the [2016](news-clippings/2016_may_gov_1.png)
[ones](news-clippings/2016_may_gov_2.png):

* "'Trust.' There are students who don't trust their teachers, but students should trust that their teachers have their back."
* "The AVF policy is problematic"
* "The stigma surrounding CP and Honors classes ... Honors students are automatically the 'smart kids'"
* "Students are not given enough of a role in making the decisions that affect them. While student complaints are listened to, they are rarely addressed"

And, of course, there are efforts to [reform the elections](news-clippings/2015_nov_student_government.png).

School Committee
----

The Register Forum recently started reporting more on school committee
meetings, and did a very nice job summarizing them:

* At the [December 6, 2016 meeting](news-clippings/2016_dec_school_committee.png), the school committee discussed menstrual hygine products in bathrooms (something students pushed hard on and won (article 1 [(pg 1)](news-clippings/2017_feb_hygiene_1.png)/[(pg 2)](news-clippings/2017_feb_hygiene_2.png) and [article 2](news-clippings/2016_dec_feminine.png)), the Cambridge fire, and athletics coach evaluation
* The [March 2017](news-clippings/2017_march_school_committee.png) discussed union contract negotiations, 9th grade leveling up, lack of space and teachers for science classes, and expanding mediation
* The [May 2017](news-clippings/2017_may_school_committee_extension.png) meeting discussed equality in athletics, strategic initiatives, and recognized student reps
* The [June 2017](news-clippings/2017_june_school_committee.png) meeting discussed the extensions school, and why it was helpful to many students, sexual assault plans, and the process around hiring a coach
* The [January 2017](news-clippings/2017_jan_paus.png) meeting discussed PAUS performing in the 14th percentile of Massachusetts schools, student government data collection on demographics of extracurriculars, and an update from the superintendent
* The [November 2016](news-clippings/2016_nov_sc_tracking.png) meeting discussed leveling up, crew funding, CPAC, the achievement gap, and a report from the superintendent.
* The [October 2016](news-clippings/2016_oct_sc_update.png) meeting talked about special needs students, student government activities, failing algebra programs, and no-cut sports teams
* The [September 2016](news-clippings/2016_sept_sc_update.png) meeting discussed dress code, junior kindergarten, overcrowding, chronic absenteeism, and the student government's work on the achievement gap 
* The [June 2016](news-clippings/2016_jube_sc_diversity.png) meeting focused on issues of race, with much empathy, but little specific action
* Many people raised issues of recruitment of faculty of color at the May 2016 session [pg 1](news-clippings/2016_may_diversity_1.png) [pg 2](news-clippings/2016_may_diversity_2.png)
* The [major issues](news-clippings/2016_nov_sc_rep.png) addressed by the commmittee in 2016 were leveling-up, dress code revisions, school climate, teacher diversity, sexual assauly, and creating safe spaces.

There was also some coverage of the past two elections:

* In 2015, there were [two](news-clippings/2015_candidate_profiles_1.png) [pages](news-clippings/2015_candidate_profiles_2.png) of candidate profiles, and we [were fortunate](news-clippings/2015_sc_election.png) to have Emily Dexter and Manikka Bowman add their talents to the school committee. Issues identified were perception of the school system, lack of inclusiveness, and lack of diversity in honors classes.
* In 2013, we [were fortunate](news-clippings/2013_nov_new_sc_1.png) to have Fran Cronin and Kathleen Kelly add their talents to the school committee. Will MacArthur (expressed skepticism)[2013_nov_new_sc_2.png](news-clippings/2013_nov_new_sc_2.png) about both.


Curriculum
----

Curriculum was discussed quite a bit. I'll omit many articles on specific classes added and removed, but there was a series of articles on the Common Core and the change from MCAS to PARCC as it pertains to CRLS. The Oct 2013 issue explained the overall change ([pg 1](news-clippings/2013_oct_common_core_1.png), [pg 2](news-clippings/2013_oct_common_core_2.png)). There was a critique of how [such common standards](news-clippings/2014_jan_common_core.png) sometimes failed to meet the individual needs of different students, and [some notes](news-clippings/2014_mar_cambridge_common_core.png) about how it moves algebra to later grades and testing online. In 2015, an article ([pg 1](news-clippings/2015_june_parcc.png) [pg 2](news-clippings/2015_june_parcc_2.png)) discussed how the district flip-flopped, and decided not to adopt PARCC. The rationale for the flip-flop, as presented in the article, felt rock-solid. Patty Nolan pointed out that the PARCC "is being developed and run by a for-profit company, which may lead to greater costs and less transparency." We already spend far too much on testing, and the whole point of such testing is increased transparency. Common core was confused with [No Child Left Behind](news-clippings/2015_april_common_core.png). This was disentangled in another article which pointed out that teachers were universally in [favor of Common Core](news-clippings/2015_april_survey_common_core.png), but opposed to the high-stakes testing which went with it. Despite the coverage, most students [knew fairly little](news-clippings/2015_may_common_core.png) about Common Core.


Of the proposed changes to curriculum, one which came up [several times](news-clippings/2017_april_mandatory_civics.png) was a required [civics course](news-clippings/2015_april_civics_requirement.png) (and there were several similar arguments for philosophy, as well as a range of diversity-related classes, especially in regards to moving history to be [less focused on Europe](news-clippings/2014_mar_history_curriculum.png)).

Another article which jumped out at me, not so much for the proposed course but for the language used to describe it, was [gender theory](news-clippings/2017_may_gender_theory.png)

Of course, adding more to the curriculum may require a [longer school day](news-clippings/2013_sept_school_day.png), as was debated in 2013, but shot down due to lack of specificity, or [restructuring vacation breaks](news-clippings/2014_mar_vacation_break.png)

[2015_may_school_dat.png](news-clippings/2015_may_school_dat.png)
[2016_feb_block_schedule.png](news-clippings/2016_feb_block_schedule.png)

[2015_may_humanities.png](news-clippings/2015_may_humanities.png)

Underlying curriculum is the purpose of school: [pg 1](news-clippings/2013_jan_why_school_1.png) [pg 2](news-clippings/2013_jan_why_school_2.png).

[2017_jan_level_up.png](news-clippings/2017_jan_level_up.png)


Student rights
----

CRLS is monitored by [45 cameras](news-clippings/2013_nov_crls_surveillance.png). The 69% of students who are even aware of this seem generally okay with this level of surveillance. 8% have had their posessions searched on campus. Indeed, most students would rather have [more security](news-clippings/2013_nov_safety_perception.png) rather than more privacy, despite already feeling safe.

The Register Forum is in favor of free speech, except [in school](news-clippings/2015_jan_free_speech.png). An [editorial](news-clippings/2016_april_free_speech.png) disagreed, and said we shouldn't have free speech where speech might be offensive. Another piece said [we should have free speech](news-clippings/2016_feb_no_free_speech.png), although without commenting on that right in the context of school. Fortunately, a 2017 article describes how devestating such mental [censorship is in schools](news-clippings/2017_march_censor.png), and how without being able to discuss offensive views, it's impossible to learn to reason critically.


Digital
----

The school adopted Chromebooks in 2013. Overall, 70% of students [were satisified](news-clippings/2013_jan_chromebooks.png). Most of the rationale was around workflow improvements. Curiously, there was no discussion about putting in a consumption technology in education, a process fundamentally about construction which many would argue is better suited to a full computer. There was also little discussion about how these impacted student outcomes. The school filters the internet, something students are [overwhelmingly supportive of](news-clippings/2013_april_firewall.png). For the most part, students considered [cyberbullying bad, but did not hold social media sites responsible](news-clippings/2013_april_cyberbully.png). Students are also starting to notice technology [can be hurtful](news-clippings/2015_nov_tech.png)


Attendance
----

There was a long series on the policy on punishing students for missed attendance. The [first of these](news-clippings/2012_Nov_AVF.pdf) found that 78% of students thought the policy was unfair, and 19% had a violation. Official school statistics were that 80 students reach AVF each term. There was a belief that the policy disadvantaged [students who live far from the school](news-clippings/2013_dec_crls_avf_policy.png). Finally, the school committee removed even the option to [buy back](news-clippings/2015_feb_avf_buyback.png) attendance violations, so they result in an automatic 10% grade penalty.

Dress code
----

Much of the push for the new dress code came from a series of a long student drive, including no fewer than five articles in the Register, including [a balanced 2014 introduction of the issue](news-clippings/2014_nov_dress_code.png) which pointed out 2-3x as many girls were effected as boys, [an opposing piece in 2015](news-clippings/2015_may_dress_code.png), a [scathing 2015 piece](news-clippings/2015_june_dress_code.png), a piece expressing that the dress code ["sets a precedent that sexual assault is unavoidable and victims are completely responsible"](news-clippings/2015_sept_sexist_dress.png), and a final piece expressing the dress code is [among other things, racist](news-clippings/2016_june_dress_code_divides.png).

Programs and organizations
----

* Upperclassmen mentor freshman. [pg 1](news-clippings/2014_jan_mentoring_1.png) [pg 2](news-clippings/2014_jan_mentoring_2.png)
* Friends of CRLS funds many programs and links to HSBA [1](news-clippings/2014_apr_friends_of_crls.png) [2.1](news-clippings/2014_nov_friends_of_crls.png)/[2.2](news-clippings/2014_nov_friends_of_crls_2.png)
* The school has [511 plans for students with disabilities](news-clippings/2011_june_411_on_504_plans.png),

Standardized tests, accreditation, rankings
----

* CRLS was accredited by NEASC, which holds a standard higher than stte/federal. It went on probabation in 2014 ([pg 1](news-clippings/2012_Nov_NEASC_1.png) [pg 2](news-clippings/2012_Nov_NEASC_2.png))
* A [2014 article](news-clippings/2014_april_standardized_testing.png) talks about how curriculum standards and tests scare off good teachers and discourage risk taking.
* The [SAT was redesigned](news-clippings/2015_nov_testing.png) to make it more meaninful in 2014, with more changes [coming in 2016](news-clippings/2014_apr_sat_changes.png). It still drew a harsh [critique](news-clippings/2014_mar_revamp_sat.png).

School divisions
----

Many articles talk about [racial/gender/LGBTQ
divides](news-clippings/2013_feb_race.png), but other divides are
raised as well.

Articles talk about [freshman-senior
divides](news-clippings/2013_nov_freshman_senior_divide.png), issues
facing foreign students in 2014 ([pg
1](news-clippings/2013_nov_international_1.png) [pg
2](news-clippings/2013_nov_international_2.png)) and again [in
2017](news-clippings/2016_jan_foreign_students.png) (which suggest
need for better on-boarding and expectation-setting, as well as better
support for ESL students), rivalaries based on
[wards](news-clippings/2014_dec_ward_rivalries.png). And, of course,
people talk about [stereotyping and superficial
diversity](news-clippings/2017_jan_superficial_diversity.png).

On the "standard" divides, we see them in
[extracurriculars](news-clippings/2016_march_racial_diversity.png),
[sports and classes](news-clippings/2015_june_segregation.png). We
have calls for addressing
[sexism](news-clippings/2015_june_sexism.png), [transgender
issues](news-clippings/2015_june_transgender.png),



Bubbles
----

An article pointed out the [Cambridge
Bubble](news-clippings/2013_feb_bubble.png) makes people unfit to
operate outside of Cambridge. The sentiment around needing to "have to
teach my beliefs" is almost identical to that expressed by some
Christians I've interacted with in the south, albeit with a very
different set of values which must be taught.

There was a fair bit of coverage of the 2014 walk-out ([pg
1](news-clippings/2014_dec_walkout_1.png) [pg
2](news-clippings/2014_dec_walkout_2.png)). An article points out that
[protests work, but not on their
own](news-clippings/2014_dec_do_protests_work.png). Missing from the
article is that for protests to work, they must be visible to people
who don't already agree with you, and visible in a positive way. My
take on many protests is summarized in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc).

School climate
----


[2016_feb_sitting_desks.png](news-clippings/2016_feb_sitting_desks.png)


Cambridge Education Association
----

An article gave an overview of [teachers' unions](news-clippings/2013_april_union.png) nationwide. In 2014, the contract negotiations became a little bit heated ([pg 1](news-clippings/2014_feb_cea_union_1.png) [pg 2](news-clippings/2014_feb_cea_union_2.png)). I'm still trying to figure out the major points of contention.

Interviews
----
* In a [2016 interview](news-clippings/2016_may_salim.png), superintendent Salim said actually very little beyond expressing empathy with CPSD values.
* In a [2016 interview](news-clippings/2016_may_young.png), superintendent Young said equally little, although I found it interesting he perceived a tension betwen "academic excellence and social justice"
* [Police Officer Daniliuk](news-clippings/2016_may_police_interview.png) was a bit more forthcoming, and spoke about the loss of the middle class, some of the professional development in the CPD, and similar
* [Mazen](news-clippings/2014_may_nadeem.png) spoke about connections of students to industry, although I'm not quite sure everything he said we've seen work in schools was backed by evidence.
* In a [later interview](news-clippings/2017_jan_salim.png), superintendent Salim said a bit more. At this point, he had visited all eighteen schools, and was able to accurately identify issues and start to prioritize. I'd summarize, but there's a bit too much -- it's worth a read.
* And, former Register Forum editor [Will MacArthur](news-clippings/2017_jan_will_macarthur.png) was interviewed when he announced his candidacy
