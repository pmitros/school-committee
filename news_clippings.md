CRLS Register Forum News Clippings
================

Student voices are important. The CRLS Register Forum is the oldest
student newspaper in the nation and provides some of those voices.

Data
----

The Register Forum ran a number of surveys providing key data which
may help guide policy decisions:

* Most CRLS students [speak another language
  fluently](news-clippings/2011_Dec_Bilingual.png), and find that it
  helps in their day-to-day lives.
* CRLS is [quite religiously
  diverse](news-clippings/2012_Nov_religious_diversity.png), with
  atheists/agnostics at 46%, Christians at 31%, Jewish at 12%, and
  Muslim at 7%. [More than
  70%](news-clippings/2013_april_religion.png) support seperation of
  church and state in schools.
* However, there is little [political
  diversity](news-clippings/2016_oct_political_diversity.png). 80% of
  the student supported Clinton, followed by Sanders. Under 3% of
  students supported Trump.
* Only about [half](news-clippings/2013_april_homework.png) of
  students find homework useful. Curiously, the article cited research
  literature which showed a correlation between how much homework
  students did and test scores (rather than research literature which
  showed no correlation between how much homework was assigned and
  test scores).
* The [vast majority](news-clippings/2013_april_neap.png) -- 82% -- of
  CRLS students find classes to be rigorous enough. Only 7% thought
  they should be more challenging.
* Students overwhelmingly recognize that [suspension doesn't
  work](news-clippings/2013_april_suspension.png). Suspended students
  get a mini-vacation, and fall further behind. What was striking was
  how prevalent suspension was -- 40 out of 88 students surveyed had
  been suspended.
* Students were [split](news-clippings/2013_nov_achievement_gap.png)
  as to who was responsible for solving the achievement gap -- the
  federal government, state government, city government, school
  committee, or the school. Curiously, neither students, parents,
  communities, nor teachers were even listed as an option.
* Most students feel their friends, homeroom, classes, and afterschool
  activities are at least [somewhat
  diverse](news-clippings/2013_nov_diverse_friends.png), or at least felt
  this way in 2013.
* Overall, students thought that [better teachers should be paid
  more](news-clippings/2011_june_good_teachers.png), with a bit of a
  discussion about tests versus student perception as a means of
  evaluating teachers (missing were peer or administor
  evaluations). An article a few years later looked at [what students
  valued in
  teachers](news-clippings/2013_nov_what_students_value_in_classes.png). Top
  was caring about the topic, followed by being available to students.
* There was an [overwhelming
  correlation](news-clippings/2015_may_electronics_academic.png)
  between unplugging digital devices and school performance. 95% of
  kids who had GPAs below 90 used digital devices at least three hours
  per day, while only 14% of those with GPAs above 90 did so. This
  result is strong enough and important enough to be publication-worthy.
* Surprisingly, in a 2014 survey, [56% of students didn't know the
  term
  gender-binary](news-clippings/2014_feb_gender_binary_poll.png). In
  recent years, topics of diversity formed the plurality of articles
  in the Register Forum, so this result might be different today.

Student Government Candidate Profiles
----

Among my favorite articles we saw the reasons many students ran for
student council. As with the school committee, diversity and the
achievement gap were the plurality reason for running, followed by
dress code, but otherwise, choice quotes:

* "'Trust.' There are students who don't trust their teachers, but students should trust that their teachers have their back."
* "The AVF policy is problematic"
*

School Committee
----

The Register Forum recently started reporting on school committee
meetings, and did a very good job summarizing them:

* At the [December 6, 2016 meeting](news-clippings/2016_dec_school_committee.png), the school committee discussed menstrual hygine products in bathrooms (something students pushed hard on and won (article 1 [(pg 1)](news-clippings/2017_feb_hygiene_1.png)/[(pg 2)](news-clippings/2017_feb_hygiene_2.png) and [article 2](news-clippings/2016_dec_feminine.png))), the Cambridge fire, and athletics coach evaluation
* The [March 2017](news-clippings/2017_march_school_committee.png) discussed union contract negotiations, 9th grade leveling up, lack of space and teachers for science classes, and expanding mediation. 
* The [May 2017](news-clippings/2017_may_school_committee_extension.png) meeting discussed equality in athletics, strategic initiatives, and recognized student reps.
* The [June 2017](news-clippings/2017_june_school_committee.png) meeting discussed the extensions school, and why it was helpful to many students, sexual assault plans, and the process around hiring a coach.

Curriculum
----

Curriculum was discussed quite a bit. I'll omit many articles on specific classes added and removed, but there was a series of articles on the Common Core and the change from MCAS to PARCC as it pertains to CRLS. The Oct 2013 issue explained the overall change ([pg 1](news-clippings/2013_oct_common_core_1.png), [pg 2](news-clippings/2013_oct_common_core_2.png)). There was a critique of how [such common standards](news-clippings/2014_jan_common_core.png) sometimes failed to meet the individual needs of different students, and [some notes](news-clippings/2014_mar_cambridge_common_core.png) about how it moves algebra to later grades and testing online. 

[2015_april_common_core.png](news-clippings/2015_april_common_core.png)
[2015_april_survey_common_core.png](news-clippings/2015_april_survey_common_core.png)
[2015_may_common_core.png](news-clippings/2015_may_common_core.png)


Of the proposed changes to curriculum, one which came up [several times](news-clippings/2017_april_mandatory_civics.png) was a required [civics course](news-clippings/2015_april_civics_requirement.png) (and there were several similar arguments for philosophy, as well as a range of diversity-related classes, especially in regards to moving history to be [less focused on Europe](news-clippings/2014_mar_history_curriculum.png)).

Another article which jumped out at me, not so much for the proposed course but for the language used to describe it, was [gender theory](news-clippings/2017_may_gender_theory.png)

Of course, adding more to the curriculum may require a [longer school day](news-clippings/2013_sept_school_day.png), as was debated in 2013, but shot down due to lack of specificity, or [restructuring vacation breaks](news-clippings/2014_mar_vacation_break.png)

Underlying curriculum is the purpose of school: [pg 1](news-clippings/2013_jan_why_school_1.png) [pg 2](news-clippings/2013_jan_why_school_2.png).

Student rights
----

CRLS is monitored by [45 cameras](news-clippings/2013_nov_crls_surveillance.png). The 69% of students who are even aware of this seem generally okay with this level of surveillance. 8% have had their posessions searched on campus. Indeed, most students would rather have [more security](news-clippings/2013_nov_safety_perception.png) rather than more privacy, despite already feeling safe.

[2016_feb_no_free_speech.png](news-clippings/2016_feb_no_free_speech.png)

Digital
----

The school adopted Chromebooks in 2013. Overall, 70% of students [were satisified](news-clippings/2013_jan_chromebooks.png). Most of the rationale was around workflow improvements. Curiously, there was no discussion about putting in a consumption technology in education, a process fundamentally about construction which many would argue is better suited to a full computer. There was also little discussion about how these impacted student outcomes. The school filters the internet, something students are [overwhelmingly supportive of](news-clippings/2013_april_firewall.png). For the most part, students considered [cyberbullying bad, but did not hold social media sites responsible](news-clippings/2013_april_cyberbully.png).

Attendance
----

There was a long series on the policy on punishing students for missed attendance. [2012_Nov_AVF.pdf](news-clippings/2012_Nov_AVF.pdf) [2013_dec_crls_avf_policy.png](news-clippings/2013_dec_crls_avf_policy.png) [2015_feb_avf_buyback.png](news-clippings/2015_feb_avf_buyback.png)

Dress code
----

Much of the push for the new dress code came from a series of a long student drive, including no fewer than five articles in the Register, including [2014_nov_dress_code.png](news-clippings/2014_nov_dress_code.png). [2015_june_dress_code.png](news-clippings/2015_june_dress_code.png) [2015_may_dress_code.png](news-clippings/2015_may_dress_code.png) [2015_sept_sexist_dress.png](news-clippings/2015_sept_sexist_dress.png) [2016_june_dress_code_divides.png](news-clippings/2016_june_dress_code_divides.png)
