Some quotes on testing
======================

>When tests are used in ways that meet relevant psychometric, legal,
>and educational standards, students’ scores provide important
>information that, combined with information from other sources, can
>lead to decisions that promote student learning and equality of
>opportunity. ... When test use is inappropriate, especially in making
>highstakes decisions about individuals, it can undermine the quality
>of education and equality of opportunity. ... This lends special
>urgency to the requirement that test use with high-stakes consequences
>for individual students be appropriate and fair.

> “accountable” for the failure of the schools,

> The proper use of tests can result in wiser decisions

> The improper use of tests, however, can cause
> considerable harm to test takers and other parties
> affected by test-based decisions.

> Tests are not perfect. Test questions are a sample of possible questions that could be
> asked in a given area. Moreover, a test score is not an exact measure of a student’s
> knowledge or skills. A student’s score can be expected to vary across different versions
> of a test – within a margin of error determined by the reliability of the test – as a
> function of the particular sample of questions asked and/or transitory factors, such as
> the student’s health on the day of the test. Thus, no single test score can be considered
> a definitive measure of a student’s knowledge.
> 
> An educational decision that will have a major impact on a test taker should not be
> made solely or automatically on the basis of a single test score. Other relevant
> information about the student’s knowledge and skills should also be taken into account
