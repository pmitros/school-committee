Evidence-based education
==============

Most good ideas in education were invented hundreds of years ago by
great educational philosophers, from Aristotle to Dewey to
Monressori. The problem was we had no idea which ones worked.

In roughly the sixties, we started to see increased numbers of
rigorous psychological experiments and population studies no what did
and didn't work in education. Some philosophies turned out to not
work, while others turned out to have effects which were [rather
large](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf). In the
nineties, we started to see increased numbers of metastudies --
compilations of prior studies -- which showed with high levels of
rigour not just what worked, but effect sizes.

Some effect sizes were rather large. In a study of over 6,000 students
in 60 classrooms, interactive engagement more than doubled learning
gains.

What we learned in this process is that there are no silver bullets;
education is too complex for that. We need to design our educational
process to follow *many* principles. We want to:

* Keep students motivated
* Give students tools to monitor their own learning, to have feedback and
  remediate when they make a mistake
* To move at their own speed until they achieve mastery of a given concept.

How do we do that? There are many ways. Techniques can leverage peers,
teachers, parents, technology, or other places. Which works best
depends on the discipline, age, and economic constraints. Applied effectively, these allow underperforming students to succeed,
and more advanced students to excel.

Applied inappropriately, whether by adding more

[teachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fqu2tXLtpO8), or otherwise
to classrooms, without a good idea of why, tends to result in minimal
or no positive effect.

Over the past half-decade, I've immersed myself in the study of most
major education research communities. I've served on working groups
with presidents of all of the educational technology research
sciences. I'd like to bring that experience to bring rigorous,
evidence-based education to our classrooms.
