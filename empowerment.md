Empowering Organizational Change
=========================

If you've ever tried to improve things in CPSD, you know it's
sometimes like running into a brick wall. That's a broad
organizational problem. The role of the School Committee and the
administration ought to be to facilitate, encourage, support, and
streamline rather than to dictate. Organizations can improve very
quickly when management moves from control to empowerment, especially
when combined with mechanisms to spread best practices.

CPSD has had this problem for a long time. As I've learned about the
history of CPSD, what struck me was how many good ideas came from the
wrong places. The Innovation Agenda was a terrific set of ideas. It
fell on its face because it was forced top-down on teachers and
parents, missing many of the realities on the ground. At the same
time, it seems to be an open secret that the school administration
retaliates against teachers who speak up publicly or try to change
things.

I would like to flip CPSD around to behave like a modern organization
where our teachers are empowered to do a great job. I would like to:

* Enable parents, students, researchers, and teachers to become change
  agents. If you would like to make a change in your child's
  classroom, the school administration should help you make it happen,
  not to find policies to block you.
* Dramatically increase the resources for innovation. Did you know
  teachers have a discretionary budget of [just
  $400](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/hr/employment_info_teachers-admin_a-b.pdf)
  for instructional materials? For a classroom of 20 students, that's
  $20 per student. To have progress, we need to not just empower
  teachers but give them enough resources. Students and teachers do
  better, even if just by the [Hawthorne
  Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect).
* Widely promote the changes which work. We should be yelling about
  good things happening in the district from the rooftops! I would
  like to build more connections with Cambridge Day, Cambridge
  Chronicle, Cambridge Civic Journal, o we can publicize many of the
  great things that happen in the district, and encourage more people
  to get involved. One of the key roles of the school committee ought
  to be identifying what works -- whether in schools, individual
  classrooms, or even individual students -- and promoting
  it. Cheerleading successes both helps build culture of excellence,
  and helps such successes spread.
* Provide much greater transparency into our schools and into our
  classrooms. If a teacher is doing something which works, we should
  know about it! If an HGSE researcher wants to improve our schools,
  they should know enough to get started.
* Build communication channels so that when something is working in
  one classroom, it can spread to other classrooms around the district
  and beyond.
* Convert most of the rules and requirements that the school committee
  has burdened everyone with into guidelines. Between federal, state,
  and district regulations, teachers are tightly boxed in. [This
  list](http://cpsd.us/departments/legal_counsel/c_p_s_policies_and_procedures)
  is just a start of what teachers, parents, and students must deal
  with. Most of these are carefully thought out and very reasonable,
  and would make ideal guidelines.
* Parents are perhaps the most important part of student outcomes. We
  need for the schools to engage all parents early and bring them into
  working in collaboration with the school. Before we have universal
  pre-K, we can do a lot more to get parents involved, even in fairly
  lightweight ways. The school should offer parenting classes,
  volunteer opportunities, and build a social engagement. Each parent
  should have a point of contact -- be that a school employee or a
  classroom parent -- to walk them through the school lottery and
  application processes, services the city provides, and any other
  parenting support they might need from the time a child is born.
