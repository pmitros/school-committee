Empowering Organizational Change
=========================

As I've read the history of CPSD, what struck me was how many good
ideas came from the wrong places. The Innovation Agenda was a terrific
set of ideas. It fell flat on its face because it was forced top-down
on teachers and parents, and missed many of the realities on the
ground.

I would like to flip CPSD around to behave like a modern organization
where our teachers are empowered to do a great job. I would like to:

* Enable parents, students, researchers, and teachers to become change
  agents. If you would like to make a change in your child's
  classroom, it should be the role of the school administration to
  help you make it happen, not to find policies to block you
* Dramatically increase the resources for innovation. Did you know
  teachers have a discretionary budget of [just
  $400](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/hr/employment_info_teachers-admin_a-b.pdf)
  for instructional materials? For a classroom of 20 students, that's
  $20 per student. To have progress, we need to resource and empower
  teachers to experiment. Students and teachers do better, even if
  just by the [Hawthorne
  Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect).
* Widely promote the changes which work. We should be yelling about
  good things happening in the district from the rooftops! I would
  like to build connections with local newspapers so we can publicize
  many of the great things that happen in the district, and encourage
  more people to get involved.
* Provide much greater transparency into our schools and into our
  classrooms. If a teacher is doing something which works, we should
  know about it! If an HGSE researcher wants to improve our schools,
  they should know enough to get started.
* Build communication channels so that when something is working in
  one classroom, it can spread to other classrooms around the district
  and beyond
* Convert most of the rules and requirements that the school committee
  has burdened everyone with into guidelines. Between federal, state,
  and district regulations, teachers are tightly boxed in. [This
  list](http://cpsd.us/departments/legal_counsel/c_p_s_policies_and_procedures)
  is just a start of what teachers, parents, and students must deal
  with. Most of these are carefully thought out and very reasonable,
  and would make ideal guidelines.
