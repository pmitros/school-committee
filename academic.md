Academic credentials
========

While I don't have a degree in education, in my time, I've taken a few online courses on education:

* "Saving Schools" parts 1, 3, and 4 from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. This is a set of short courses on school policy.
* "Leaders of Learning" from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
* "Surviving Your Rookie Year of Teaching" from Match Teacher Residency
* "Coaching Teachers: Promoting Changes that Stick" from Match Teacher Residency
* "Teaching Character and Creating Positive Classrooms" from the Relay Graduate School of Education
* "Foundations of Teaching for Learning 3: Learners and Learning" from the Commonwealth Education Trust
* "Foundations of Teaching for Learning 6: Introduction to Student Assessment"from the Commonwealth Education Trust
* "ICT in Primary Education: Transforming children's learning across the curriculum" from the University of London
* "Instructional Methods in Health Professions Education" from the University of Michigan
* "Applying Principles of Behavior in the K-12 Classroom" from the University of Houston System

I've given around twenty keynotes, panel discussions, and other
invited talks on education, published about a dozen peer-reviewed
publications, and chaired a few research conference tracks. I have
some background in early childhood development, including adapting one
of my favorite courses (from the University of Washington) into [a
podcast format](http://podcasts.edx.org/ecfs312x/).
