Open edX
====

A bit over a half-decade ago, based on my work on education in
Nigeria, I proposed to MIT an initiative based on using technology to
bring research-based educational best practices to scale. I built that
platform, and it became Open edX.


Despite its image as a MOOC provider in the popular press, edX does
tremendous amounts of on-campus work, and has been incredibly
effective at accelerating learning across very diverse settings. For
example, we were able to work with MIT to [quadruple the number of
correct
answers](http://web.mit.edu/3.091x/www/3091r%20Final%20report.pdf) on
final exams in solid state chemistry, with SJSU -- a school serving a
diverse and disadvantaged population -- to bring course completion
rates [from 59% to
91%](https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/upload/ed-tech-paper.pdf)
(almost entirely closing the achievement gap between SJSU and MIT),
with schools around the world,
[online](https://science.mit.edu/news/study-online-classes-really-do-work),
and with having students at community colleges master materials from
MIT courses.

In this role, I've also interfaced with most of the education research
communities, including psychometricians, constructivists,
connectivists, educational policy researchers, educational dataminers,
and many others, and developed a broad understanding of what does and
doesn't work in education, as well as relationships with top
researchers in the field.

I would like to bring that experience to bring evidence-based and
research-based best practice to your schools.
