Bringing CPSD business practices into the 21st century
==========

Evaluation
--------

The school has tremendous numbers of programs and initiatives with no
real evaluation on return-on-investment or on effectiveness. [More
than a
third](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/financial/budget/fy2018/FY2018_ADOPTED_BUDGET_web.pdf)
of CPSD employees operate outside of the classroom, including many of
the most highly paid. Are these roles wildly successful? Or are we
seeing almost no return here? We don't really know. We need to know so
we can invest more in things which work and less in things which do
not.

I would like to put in processes so we may evaluate what does and
doesn't work, and direct our funding and energy towards initiatives
which demonstrably improve student outcomes. Along lines of this, I
will work to streamline processes and improve transparency, especially
to parents.

Transparency, communication, and collaboration
--------

The school should shift to process where everything is open unless
there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.

This is a quality issue. We have some of the best teachers in the
world, and we need to find ways to spread best practices. This is an
equity issue. Parents without strong networks have a difficult time
figuring out what's going on. This is an empowerment issue too. People
can't be empowered to act if they don't know what's going on.


Fix the lottery
--------

Reduce regulation
--------

The school district has a tremendous number of very well-thought-out
policies. They individually make sense, but together, they're
disempowering to teachers and prevent continued improvement and
innovation. I would like to convert as many of these as possible from
regulations into guidelines.

Engage with researchers
--------

Engage teachers in the community
--------

Did you know many CPSD teachers can't send their own kids here? The
wages from the schools no longer support the cost-of-living in
Cambridge, and the school does not allow employees to send their own
kids to the sc hool. Good companies have employees [use their own
products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). Employees
can't make informed decisions otherwise, and teachers, likewise,
should be able to see how schools impact their own kids. That also
brings teachers into the community, give teachers a heck of a lot more
time (whether for work or family), and is just basic decency as an employer.
