The school has tremendous numbers of programs and initiatives with no
real evaluation on return-on-investment or on effectiveness. [More
than a
third](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/financial/budget/fy2018/FY2018_ADOPTED_BUDGET_web.pdf)
of CPSD employees operate outside of the classroom, including many of
the most highly paid. Are we seeing enough return here? We don't
really know. We need to know so we can invest more in things which
work and less in things which do not.

I would like to put in processes so we may
evaluate what does and doesn't work, and direct our funding and energy
towards initiatives which demonstrably improve student outcomes. Along
lines of this, I will work to streamline processes and improve
transparency, especially to parents.
