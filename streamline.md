Bringing CPSD business practices into the 21st century
==========

While I've been impressed with most individuals in the district at all
levels, the overall organizational dynamics connecting those
individuals are broken. The school committee, as a body, is
ineffective. Decisions are being made in all the wrong places. We have
many programs with no real idea whether they work.

Many organizational processes are defunct. Have you tried going
through the school lottery?  Registering for afterschool?  Simply
moving to modern management techniques, improving transparency and
communications, and moving towards digital processes can lower costs,
save both parents and school employees time (giving more time to
interact with students), and make everything work better.

I've been involved in three organizations since finishing my Ph.D. The
first developed a medical imaging technology which has saved many
lives. It sold for $200 million. The second developed a technology
which has helped educate millions. It's valued at over $1 billion. The
third is edX, an MIT-Harvard education initiative, which has also
positively impact millions of lives. In those roles, I've learned
about managing modern, efficient organizations.

I'd like to bring that experience to bear to streamline and fix many
of the organizational processes to have the district function like a
modern, transparent, easy-to-engage-with organization. The key changes
I'd like to see are:

Proper use of evaluation and assessment
--------

The school has tremendous numbers of programs and initiatives with no
real evaluation on return-on-investment or on effectiveness. [More
than a
third](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/financial/budget/fy2018/FY2018_ADOPTED_BUDGET_web.pdf)
of CPSD employees operate outside of the classroom, including many of
the most highly paid. Are these positions effective? How effective
are co-teachers? Do we need more of fewer? How much benefit do we see
from the expensive busing scheme? We don't really know. I would like
to put in processes so we may evaluate what does and doesn't work, and
direct our funding and energy towards initiatives which demonstrably
improve student outcomes. We need to know so we can invest more in
things which work and less in things which do not.

Of course, evaluation and assessment has a long history of misuse in
school systems for decades. Where assessment fails is when [it is used
in isolation or tied directly to incentives](testing.md).  There are
many things we don't know how to measure, and once assessment is tied
to incentives, those tend to fall by the wayside. However, used
correctly, with the understanding that much of evaluation is
qualitative and needs to be combined with theoretical and
substantive arguments, more knowledge is better.

However, used correctly, integrating different types of evidence, and
not tied to high stakes, students, teachers, and school systems do
better with testing, monitoring, feedback, and continued
assessment. That is established science.

Transparency, communication, and collaboration
--------

Along lines of this, I will work to improve transparency. As ground rules:

* The school committee should articulate firm support for first amendment
  rights for students, teachers, and other school employees. 
* All school employees should be free to engage in public civic
  discourse on the school system, engage in conversations with
  parents, and with all levels of the administration without fear of
  reprisal
* The school should promptly respond to all legal FOIA requests
* Presenters in the public comment periods should have the option
  of adding written text included with the meeting minutes

From there, the school should shift to processes where everything is
open unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise, and where
it's not only open, but where the school takes proactive steps to
spread and share information about the school system.

This is a quality issue. We have some of the best teachers in the
world, and we need to find ways to spread best practices throughout
the district. Match Education has used this [to great
effect](https://www.coursera.org/learn/coaching-teachers). This is an
equity issue. Parents without strong networks have a difficult time
figuring out what's going on. This is an empowerment issue too. People
can't be empowered to act if they don't know what's going on. This is
also a coherency issue. While I wouldn't propose extending control to
afterschool programs, more mechanisms for voluntary coordination could
help both sides.

As with any other kind of assessment, it's important that such
processes be judgment-free and geared towards improvement.


Fix the lottery
--------

This is a little technical, but the CPSD school algorithm is
broken. It leads to poor placement, and encourages gaming.
[Strong evidence of gaming](https://economics.mit.edu/files/3030)
in Boston lead Boston Public Schools to shift to a more reasonable
algorithm. In Cambridge, we have similar evidence. Indeed, some
programs (such as Chinese language immersion) are virtually impossible
to be admitted into without gaming. There are matching algorithms
which are better by every metric; we should shift to any one of
those.

**For the nerds**: The CPSD algorithm is essentially the
[Gale-Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem)
algorithm. Each parent picks schools. The school district assigns each
student a random number indicating what would be the school's
preference. The algorithm than optimizes matching. It does so
[backwards](http://web.stanford.edu/~niederle/School%20Matching%20Systems.pdf)
(optimizing to the random number rather than parent choices). Flipping
that around, and giving a different set of random numbers for each
school, would lead to both better placements *and* eliminate any
incentives to game.

**For the non-nerds**: In addition to a bad algorithm, we do a
terrible job for kids with parents who don't do the research. We can
do much better with guiding all parents to reasonable placements.

**For everyone**: The concept behind the school lottery is based on a
1960-era goal of desegregation which was adversarial with most of the
population. In 2017, most people want to be in integrated
schools. While there are some [effects we need to
manage](http://ncase.me/polygons/), a 2017 solution doesn't need to be
nearly as strict, harsh, or adversarial. Starting the school by
prominently sticking labels on kids like "low-SES" and "high-SES" on
kids leads [to negative and segregatory
effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory#Robbers_cave_study).

Reduce regulation
--------

The school district has a tremendous number of very well-thought-out
policies. They individually make sense, but together, they're
disempowering to teachers and prevent continued improvement and
innovation. I would like to convert as many of these as possible from
regulations into guidelines.

Engage with researchers
--------

We have some of the best educational research in the world right here
in Cambridge.

Why aren't we making more use of it?

Part of the answer is that CPSD is difficult for researchers to engage
with. We have no established processes for doing so, and principals
and teachers must wing it every time. I don't want to dictate a
process, but I'd like to provide a default set of guidelines so that
busy principals and teachers have an easy way to understand how to
respond to researcher requests, and I'd like to let researchers know
we're open for business with an understandable set of guidelines.

Working with Harvard, MIT, Tufts, and others is one of the best ways
to understand what happens in our district, as well as to bring in new
ideas for how to improve it.

Engage teachers in the community
--------

Did you know many CPSD teachers can't send their own kids here? The
wages from the schools no longer support the cost-of-living in
Cambridge, and the school does not allow employees to send their own
kids to the school. Good companies have employees [use their own
products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). Employees
can't make informed decisions otherwise, and teachers, likewise,
should be able to see how schools impact their own kids. That also
brings teachers into the community, give teachers a heck of a lot more
time (whether for work or family), and is just basic decency as an employer.

School committee politics
--------

The school committee processes don't work well. Visit a meeting or
read any Cambridge Day article. I'd like to shift away from sparring,
politics, and process to getting real work done.

Organizational roles
--------

The role of the school committee ought to be the same as of a
corporate board -- high level vision and strategy. The role of the
school administration ought to be to work with the school committee on
defining that and to execute on it. Most of the innovation should come
from the bottom up. The school committee should not micromanage (and
neither should higher levels of the administration).

Go digital
--------

Parents should be able to register for the school, afterschool, and
other activities online, be notified of school events without paper,
and monitor their childrens' progress. In 2017, virtually everyone,
including poorer individuals, have at least some internet access. I
don't disagree with allowing people to manage processes without it,
but for the most part, we can save huge amounts of peoples' time and
the district's money by going digital whereever possible.
