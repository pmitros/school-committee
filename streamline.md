Bringing CPSD business practices into the 21st century
==========

Evaluation and assessment
--------

The school has tremendous numbers of programs and initiatives with no
real evaluation on return-on-investment or on effectiveness. [More
than a
third](http://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/financial/budget/fy2018/FY2018_ADOPTED_BUDGET_web.pdf)
of CPSD employees operate outside of the classroom, including many of
the most highly paid. Are these wildly successful? Are we seeing
almost no return here? How effective are co-teachers? How much benefit
do we see from the expensive bussing scheme? We don't really know. I
would like to put in processes so we may evaluate what does and
doesn't work, and direct our funding and energy towards initiatives
which demonstrably improve student outcomes. We need to know so we can
invest more in things which work and less in things which do not.

Of course, there are opponents of evaluation and assessment; it has
been misused in school systems for decades. I would like to address
this head on: Students, teachers, and school systems generally do
better with frequent testing, monitoring, feedback, and
assessment. That is established science. Where assessment fails is
when [it is used in isolation or tied directly to incentives](testing.md).
There are many things we don't know how to
measure, and once assessment is tied to incentives, those tend to fall
by the wayside. However, used correctly, with the understanding that
much of evaluation is qualitative and needs to be combined with
theoretical and substantative arguments, more knowledge is better.



Transparency, communication, and collaboration
--------

Along lines of this, I will work to improve transparency, especially
to parents. The school should shift to processes where everything is
open unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. 

This is a quality issue. We have some of the best teachers in the
world, and we need to find ways to spread best practices. This is an
equity issue. Parents without strong networks have a difficult time
figuring out what's going on. This is an empowerment issue too. People
can't be empowered to act if they don't know what's going on.


Fix the lottery
--------

This is a little technical, but the CPSD school algorithm is
broken. It leads to poor placement, and encourages gaming.
[Strong evidence of gaming](https://economics.mit.edu/files/3030)
in Boston lead Boston Public Schools to shift to a more reasonable
algorithm. In Cambridge, we have similar evidence. Indeed, some
programs (such as Chinese language immersion) are virtually impossible
to be admitted into without gaming. There are matching algorithms
which are better by every metric; we should shift to any one of
those.

**For the nerds**: The CPSD algorithm is essentially the
[Gale-Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem)
algorithm. Each parent picks schools. The school district assigns each
student a random number indicating what would be the school's
preference. The algorithm than optimizes matching. It does so
backwards (optimizing to the random number rather than parent
choices). Flipping that around, and giving a different set of
preferences for each school, would lead to both better placements
*and* eliminate any reason to game.

**For the non-nerds**: We do a terrible job for kids with parents who
don't do the research. We can do much better with guiding all parents
to reasonable placements.

**For everyone**: The concept behind the school lottery is based on a
1960-era goal of desegregation which was adversarial with most of the
population. In 2017, most people want to be in integrated
schools. There are some [effects we need to
manage](http://ncase.me/polygons/), but a 2017 solution can be less
adversarial than the current system. Prominently starting the school
by sticking labels like "low-SES" and "high-SES" on kids leads (to
negative and segregatory
effects)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory#Robbers_cave_study].

Reduce regulation
--------

The school district has a tremendous number of very well-thought-out
policies. They individually make sense, but together, they're
disempowering to teachers and prevent continued improvement and
innovation. I would like to convert as many of these as possible from
regulations into guidelines.

Engage with researchers
--------

Engage teachers in the community
--------

Did you know many CPSD teachers can't send their own kids here? The
wages from the schools no longer support the cost-of-living in
Cambridge, and the school does not allow employees to send their own
kids to the sc hool. Good companies have employees [use their own
products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). Employees
can't make informed decisions otherwise, and teachers, likewise,
should be able to see how schools impact their own kids. That also
brings teachers into the community, give teachers a heck of a lot more
time (whether for work or family), and is just basic decency as an employer.
